## **Slide Title: Problem Statement**

---

### **Developers Overwhelmed by Operational Responsibilities**

- **Shift-Left Movement Challenges**:
    - Developers now handle infrastructure provisioning and deployments.
    - Increased operational burden reduces time for coding and innovation.

- **Lack of Effective Self-Service Tools**:
    - Existing solutions are complex and hard to implement (e.g., Spotify's Backstage).
    - No clear market leader providing an out-of-the-box Internal Developer Platform (IDP).

- **Operational Inefficiencies**:
    - Difficulty in bootstrapping new services with best practices ("Golden Paths").
    - Limited visibility into service ownership and configurations.
    - Challenges in collaboration and knowledge sharing.

- **Impact on Organizations**:
    - Slower release cycles and time-to-market delays.
    - Increased costs due to inefficiencies and duplicated efforts.
    - Compliance and auditing difficulties without centralized tracking.

### **Presenter Notes**:

**Introduction**:

- **Set the Context**:
    - Begin by highlighting the industry trend of the **shift-left movement**, where developers are increasingly responsible for operational tasks like infrastructure provisioning and deployments.
    - Emphasize that while this aims to accelerate development, it has unintentionally **overburdened developers**.

**Challenges Faced by Developers**:

- **Operational Overload**:
    - Discuss how developers are now expected to manage complex operational duties outside their core skill set.
    - Mention that this leads to a **steep learning curve** and diverts focus from coding and innovation.

- **Ineffective Tools**:
    - Point out that existing self-service tools, like Spotify's Backstage, are **difficult to deploy and customize**, requiring significant internal resources.
    - Stress the absence of a **clear market leader** offering a ready-to-use Internal Developer Platform (IDP).

**Operational Inefficiencies**:

- **Bootstrapping Difficulties**:
    - Explain the concept of **"Golden Paths"** and how developers struggle to bootstrap new services that adhere to best practices.
    - Highlight that without standardized templates, there's inconsistency and increased risk of errors.

- **Limited Visibility and Collaboration**:
    - Discuss how the lack of a centralized service catalog leads to difficulties in identifying service ownership.
    - Explain that this hampers collaboration and knowledge sharing among teams.

**Impact on Organizations**:

- **Delayed Release Cycles**:
    - Emphasize that operational challenges lead to **slower deployments**, affecting the organization's agility and competitiveness.

- **Increased Costs**:
    - Mention the **operational overhead** and duplicated efforts that drive up costs.

- **Compliance Challenges**:
    - Point out the difficulties in auditing and compliance due to the lack of transparent change tracking and centralized management.

**Conclusion**:

- **Summarize the Need**:
    - Reinforce that there's a **critical need for a unified Internal Developer Platform** that empowers developers with self-service capabilities.

- **Segway to Solution**:
    - Prepare the audience for the next section of the presentation, where you'll introduce your solution that addresses these challenges.
