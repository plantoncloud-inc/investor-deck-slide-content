## **Slide Title: How PlantonCloud Works**

---

### **Workflow Illustration**

1. **Resource Configuration**

    - Developers use an intuitive self-service portal to define resources through easy-to-use forms.

2. **Selection from Deployment Component Store**

    - Choose pre-built deployment components (databases, microservices, etc.) from a centralized store.

3. **Automated CI/CD Pipelines Triggered**

    - Upon configuration, zero-config infrastructure-as-code (IAC) CI/CD pipelines are automatically initiated.

4. **Deployment to Cloud Providers**

    - Resources are seamlessly deployed across multiple cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) and Kubernetes clusters.

5. **Centralized Monitoring and Management**

    - Deployed resources are visualized in the Catalog on Canvas for easy monitoring and management.

6. **Day Two Operations**

    - Perform ongoing operations like scaling, updates, and maintenance directly from the platform.

### **Integration Points with Existing Tools and Cloud Providers**

- **Supports Existing Git Repositories**

    - Integrates with GitHub, GitLab for code management without disrupting current workflows.

- **Direct Cloud Provider Integration**

    - Connects with AWS, Azure, GCP, and Kubernetes for seamless deployments.

- **Pulumi Module Registry**

    - Leverages Pulumi modules for infrastructure code, allowing the use of custom modules for flexibility.

---

### **Simplicity and Efficiency**

- **Streamlined Workflows**

    - Eliminates manual CI/CD setup and complex YAML configurations.

- **Unified Interface**

    - Provides a single platform for configuration, deployment, and management, reducing complexity and context switching.

- **Reduced Operational Overhead**

    - Automates routine tasks, freeing developers to focus on innovation and coding.
