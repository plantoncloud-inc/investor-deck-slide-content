### **Presenter Notes**

**Introduction:**

- **Overview:**
    - Our roadmap focuses on expanding PlantonCloud's capabilities, integrating cutting-edge technologies, and enhancing the user experience.
    - We aim to stay ahead of industry trends and meet the evolving needs of our users.

**1. Integrate AI and Machine Learning Workloads**

- **ProjectPlanton Enhancements:**
    - We plan to add AI and machine learning deployment components to the Deployment Component Store.
    - This includes support for deploying open-source large language models (LLMs) like LLaMA and Falcon.
    - By enabling AI workloads, we make ProjectPlanton more attractive to developers working on innovative AI applications.

- **PlantonCloud Integration:**
    - We'll develop user-friendly UI forms and workflows in PlantonCloud to configure and manage these AI workloads.
    - Provide operational assistance, such as monitoring and scaling tools, specifically for AI deployments.
    - This integration allows developers to leverage AI capabilities without deep expertise in infrastructure management.

**2. Launch a Marketplace for Extensions**

- **Enable Community Contributions:**
    - We aim to create a marketplace similar to Atlassian Marketplace or JetBrains plugins.
    - This will allow third-party developers to build and share plugins that extend PlantonCloud's UI and functionality.

- **Foster an Ecosystem:**
    - By providing the architecture and documentation for plugin development, we encourage innovation.
    - Developers can tailor the platform to specific needs, industries, or use cases.

- **Benefit Users:**
    - Users gain access to a wider array of features and integrations.
    - This approach enhances the platform without requiring all development to come from our internal team.

**3. Enhance Tooling for Microservice Development**

- **Advanced Development Tools:**
    - We'll provide more robust tools for microservice deployment, including support for Kubernetes, AWS Lambda, and Google Cloud Functions.
    - Integrate secrets management and configuration management to simplify cloud-native application development.

- **Out-of-the-Box Monitoring and Logging:**
    - Integrate monitoring tools like Prometheus and SigNoz into the platform.
    - Allow developers to easily add monitoring, logging, and tracing to their services during deployment.

- **Kubernetes Day Two Operations:**
    - Offer advanced operational capabilities for services running on Kubernetes.
    - Simplify common tasks such as scaling, updates, and maintenance directly from the PlantonCloud interface.

**4. Develop In-House Large Language Model (LLM) for ChatOps**

- **AI-Powered Operations:**
    - We'll develop an in-house LLM by training open-source models with our proprietary data.
    - This will enable ChatOps functionality, allowing users to interact with PlantonCloud using natural language.

- **Enhanced User Experience:**
    - Developers can perform complex tasks by simply typing commands like "Deploy a new Redis instance to the US Central Kubernetes cluster with 2 GB of memory."
    - This reduces the learning curve and makes the platform more accessible, especially for new users.

**Conclusion:**

- **Commitment to Innovation:**
    - Our roadmap is ambitious and aligns with the latest technological advancements.
    - We're dedicated to providing our users with powerful tools that simplify complex operations.

- **Strategic Growth:**
    - By expanding our platform's capabilities and fostering a community-driven ecosystem, we position PlantonCloud for sustained growth and industry leadership.
